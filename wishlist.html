                            I've been itching to read something lately, but don't really have much in mind. I've liked the books that Nicole has recomended to me in the past so I'd trust her judgement.

                            These are the holy grail of headphones for me. They're much more expensive than the Beyerdynamic headhpones I also have on my list.

                            I've been wanting some really good over-the-ear headphones for a while. I love the earbuds I have now, but they are starting to break apart.

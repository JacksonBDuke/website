                            I've been itching to read something lately, but don't really have much in mind. I've liked the books that Nicole has recomended to me in the past so I'd trust her judgement.

                            I've been wanting a NAS (Network Access Storage) for a while, but this is something I'll probably have to get myself. This doesn't come with any hard-drives so I'd also need a few of the hard-drives I have listed.

                            I need some extra storage. Even if I don't have a NAS to put them in, I could use some extra space to store stuff.

                            This is a game I've been wanting to try for a while. It's pretty complex, but I think it would be fun to give it a go.

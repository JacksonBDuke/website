                                VR Visual Field Test is a Unity3D application written to emulate the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) II's visual field test.<br>
                                This test was designed using the FOVE virtual reality headset, because of its integrated eye-tracking.<br>
                                For more information about visual field testing, please refer to <a href="https://www.glaucoma.org/treatment/what-is-a-visual-field-test.php">this article</a> written by the Glaucoma Research Foundation (GRF).

                                        Example pattern that the test iterates over. Only one stimulus (white dot) is visible at any one time. The yellow dot in the middle is a focal point for the patient to focus their eye on.

                                        The general flow of the test. This visualizes the process that is followed each time a stimulus is displayed and responded to (or not responded to).

                                        Example of the application's user interface as seen by the test administrator.<br>
                                        'Threshold Chart' shows established thresholds of stimuli.<br>
                                        'Current Stimulus' is a blue circle that surrounds the stimulus that was last displayed to the patient.<br>
                                        'Fixation Graph' is a bar graph that shows the fixation of the patient over time. The bars will directly relate to the distance from the middle focal point to the patient's gaze. These bars are populated dynamically at a rate of 1 per second.
                                        'Current Gaze' shows a real-time representation of where the patient's pupil is looking. This makes it possible for a test administrator to tell if a patient is deviating from the center focal point.

                                TTS Deck Builder is a small java application to aid in creating deck images for Tabletop Simulator.<br>
                                Images are copied from the system clipboard, added to a list of stored images and then exported to a large tiled image with black borders. The grid output is 10x7 with the last (70th) position reserved for a card-back that is used for when the cards are in an opponent's hand.<br>
                                For example purposes the images used will be solid colors.

                                Blocked Off is a Unity3D top-down puzzle game where you control a green cube.
			                    Avoid enemies to reach the goal at the end of the current level to progress to the next.
			                    Many more enemy types are planned to be added along with more complex puzzles that will require multiple steps of interaction to complete.
                            </p>

                                        Introduction level which simply states the objective and how to play.<br>
                                        No moving obstacles.<br>
                                        In the next two levels the player must deal with both Red enemies and Green neutral entities. Red enemies follow a pre-determined path, causing the player to start the level over if hit. Green "moving wall" entities move in a pre-determined path and do no inherent harm to the player character.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                        Purple enemies will follow the player using a simple follow script which also increases its movement-speed over time. The player character has a maximum speed, but the Purple enemies do not. Given time, the Purple enemies will catch up to the player.

                                        Level 5 is the last level in the "tutorial" section of the game. This is also the first level where a player must deal with two different kinds of enemies at once. Currently the game only consists of this tutorial section.
